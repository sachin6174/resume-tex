What an unforgettable weekend! 🚀

Out of 57,000+ developers and 9,100+ submissions, just 700 teams made it to the Google Cloud Agentic AI Day 2025, and our team Agentic Gigs was one of them!

Team members :- Praveen gupta , sachin kumar , Aftab Alam and me

We built something we’re genuinely proud of:
A platform that provides farmers with expert advice on demand, powered by Agentic AI — bridging the knowledge gap in agriculture with accessible, intelligent solutions.

Web: Next.js, Firebase, ADK

Agentic AI: Python scripting

Mobile App: Kotlin


Beyond the code, the experience was everything:
💡 30+ hours of sleepless coding
